			<key>Purpose</key>
			<string>Guided Video LLC was founded by parents who work together to develop apps for their own families, which include very young children and children with special needs.

We test this app using our own families, friends, educators, and special needs professionals.  But even so, every child is different, including yours.  So, we really do want to learn your comments and constructive criticism.  Please do not hesitate to tap the Contact button.  We truly want to hear from you, even if it’s only a single word of feedback.  You’ll inspire us to keep making the app better for the sake of all children.

Another way you can help is to rate and review this app.  Your rating and review of this app helps others discover it.  Feel good about helping others by tapping the Review button now.</string>
